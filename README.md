# New-Years-greetings-text-transfer-protocol
In today's highly open world civilisation, the cultures of different countries are widely and effectively spread and exchanged, and all parties wish to uphold the ideas of kindness, equality and harmony in their friendship. The housemates in the dormitory come from different countries and each wants the other roommates to understand the customs and culture of their own country. Due to the different study and living schedules of the roommates, face-to-face communication with each person individually may seem rushed and repetitive. This is why the group has collaborated to develop a protocol based on New Year's cultural communication. The aim of the protocol is to facilitate the multifaceted dissemination of information and to bring hostel members closer together. The details required for this protocol will be presented later in the structure.
